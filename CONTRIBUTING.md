## Licensing

This repository is under the same license as Xous itself, MIT/Apache2. You
can find the full text of each license in the `LICENSE-*` files in this
repository.

## Code of Conduct

The Rust project has [a code of conduct](http://rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct)
that governs all sub-projects, including this one. Please respect it!

## Expectations

This book is a work-in-progress, as the kernel is still being developed. Things may change, especially as we work towards a 1.0 release. Having said that, core kernel tasks tend to be more difficult to change, and are therefore less likely to have documentation changes.

## Help wanted

If you're looking for ways to help that don't involve large amounts of
reading or writing, check out the [open issues with the E-help-wanted
label][help-wanted]. These might be small fixes to the text, Rust code,
frontend code, or shell scripts that would help us be more efficient or
enhance the book in some way!

## Translations

We'd love help translating the book! See the [Translations] label to join in
efforts that are currently in progress. Open a new issue to start working on
