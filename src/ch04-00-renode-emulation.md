# Renode Emulation

[Renode](https://renode.io/) is a multi-device emulator written in C#. It is designed to assist in testing and development of software, and is also useful in developing new hardware blocks.

The emulator is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It is designed to simulate whole systems of devices, meaning it can easily capture the interactions between devices on a network or bus. It allows you to pause the system and inspect memory, single-step, and watch various sections of the bus.

There is extensive end-user documentation available at [Read the Docs](https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), which is highly recommended. The remainder of this chapter will cover recommendations on how to use Renode with Xous.
