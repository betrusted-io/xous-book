# Introduction

This book is a work in progress. Many chapters are placeholders and will appear blank.

The book is written for two audiences: kernel maintainers, and application developers.

Chapters [2 (Server Architecture)](ch02-00-server-architecture.md), [3 (Introducing the Kernel)](ch03-00-introducing-the-kernel.md), and [5 (System Startup)](ch05-00-system-startup.md) are primarily for kernel maintainers and system programmers.

Chapters [1 (Getting Started)](ch01-00-getting-started.md), [4 (Renode Emulation)](ch04-00-renode-emulation.md), [6 (Build System Overview)](ch06-00-build-system-overview.md), [7 (Messages)](ch07-00-messages.md) and [8 (Graphics)](ch08-00-graphics.md) are more appropriate for application developers.
