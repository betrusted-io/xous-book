# Introduction

This book is a work in progress. Many chapters are placeholders and will appear blank.

The book is written for two audiences: kernel maintainers, and application developers.

Chapters [2](ch02-00-server-architecture.md), [3](ch03-00-introducing-the-kernel.md), and [5](ch05-00-system-startup.md) are primarily for kernel maintainers.

Chapters [1](ch01-00-getting-started.md), [4](ch04-00-renode-emulation.md), [6](ch06-00-build-system-overview.md), [7](ch07-00-messages.md) and [8](ch08-00-graphics.md) are more appropriate for application developers.
